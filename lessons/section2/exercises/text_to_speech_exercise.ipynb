    "## Explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to convert text to speech using the `tts-1` model and save it to an MP3 file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import necessary libraries:**\n",
    "   - `Path` from `pathlib`: Used for handling file paths in a platform-independent way.\n",
    "   - `OpenAI` from `openai`: The OpenAI Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize OpenAI client:**\n",
    "   - `client = OpenAI()`: Creates an OpenAI client object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define speech file path:**\n",
    "   - `speech_file_path = \"../audio/speech.mp3\"`: Defines the path where the generated speech MP3 file will be saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate speech:**\n",
    "   - `response = client.audio.speech.create(...)`: Calls the `audio.speech.create` method to generate speech from text.\n",
    "     - `model=\"tts-1\"`: Specifies the `tts-1` model for text-to-speech.\n",
    "     - `voice=\"alloy\"`: Selects the \"alloy\" voice for the speech. OpenAI offers different voice options.\n",
    "     - `input=\"Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!\"`:  The text input that will be converted to speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stream speech to file:**\n",
    "   - `response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)`: Streams the audio response directly to the specified file path, saving the generated speech as \"speech.mp3\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet provides a basic example of converting text to speech using the OpenAI API and saving the output to an MP3 file. You can modify the `input` text to generate speech for different phrases or sentences and explore different voice options."

    "   - Change the `input` parameter in `client.audio.speech.create` to the new text.\n",
