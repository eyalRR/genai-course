    "## Explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API for basic text generation using the `gpt-4o` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import OpenAI library:**\n",
    "   - `from openai import OpenAI`: Imports the OpenAI Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize OpenAI client:**\n",
    "   - `client = OpenAI()`: Creates an OpenAI client object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate text using chat completions:**\n",
    "   - `completion = client.chat.completions.create(...)`: Calls the `chat.completions.create` method to generate text.\n",
    "     - `model=\"gpt-4o\"`: Specifies the `gpt-4o` model for text generation. This is a general-purpose model capable of handling various text-based tasks.\n",
    "     - `messages=[...]`: Defines the conversation messages. In this case, it includes a system message and a user message:\n",
    "       - `{\"role\": \"developer\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}`:  This is a system message setting the persona of the assistant to be helpful. Although the role is \"developer\" here, it should be \"system\".\n",
    "       - `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write a poem about a cat named Whiskers who loves to play with yarn.\"}`: This is the user's request, asking the model to write a poem about a specific topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print the generated message:**\n",
    "   - `print(completion.choices[0].message)`: Prints the generated message from the model. The `completion.choices` list contains completion choices, and we access the first choice (`[0]`) and then the message content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet provides a simple example of generating text using the OpenAI API. You can modify the `content` of the user message to request different types of text generation, such as stories, articles, summaries, etc. You can also adjust the system message to guide the model's behavior and persona."
