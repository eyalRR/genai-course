    "## Understanding the Message Format\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with Claude API, you communicate by sending messages. These messages need to follow a specific format to be correctly interpreted by Claude. The basic structure involves defining roles for the participants in the conversation: **user** and **assistant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Roles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **user:** Represents the end-user or the one making the request to Claude. Your prompts and questions are sent as `user` messages.\n",
    "*   **assistant:** Represents Claude, the AI model. Claude's responses are in the form of `assistant` messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages are typically sent as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message and contains two key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`role`:**  The role of the message sender (`\"user\"` or `\"assistant\"`).\n",
    "*   **`content`:** The actual text content of the message (your prompt or Claude's response).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to ask Claude: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The message would be structured like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When Claude responds, it will add an `assistant` message to the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-turn conversations, you simply append new messages to the list, maintaining the conversation history."

      "\n",
      "1. `role`: This field specifies the role of the message sender. It can be either \"system\", \"user\", or \"assistant\". The \"system\" role is used for messages that provide context or instructions to the assistant. The \"user\" role represents messages sent by the user interacting with the assistant. The \"assistant\" role represents messages sent by the AI assistant itself\n"

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`import anthropic`:** Imports the Anthropic Claude API client library.\n",
    "2.  **API Key Setup:**  Loads the API key from the `.env` file and initializes the Claude client as shown in the previous exercise.\n",
    "3.  **Message Definition:** Creates a list named `messages` containing a single dictionary. This dictionary defines a message with the role `\"user\"` and the content: \"Explain the concept of message format in Claude API for beginners.\"\n",
    "4.  **Sending Message to Claude:**\n",
    "    *   `client.messages.create(...)` sends the message to the Claude API.\n",
    "    *   `model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\"` specifies the Claude model to use. You can choose other models like `claude-2.1` or `claude-3-haiku-20240307`.\n",
    "    *   `max_tokens=200` limits the response length to 200 tokens.\n",
    "    *   `messages=messages` passes the defined message list to the API.\n",
    "5.  **Printing Response:** `print(response.content[0].text)` extracts and prints the text content of Claude's response.\n",
    "6.  **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential `anthropic.APIError` exceptions, which might occur due to invalid API keys, network issues, or API errors. It prints an error message to guide the user in troubleshooting."
