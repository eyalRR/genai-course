    "## Introduction to Few-shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique to guide Claude to generate the desired output by providing a few examples in the prompt itself. Instead of just telling Claude what to do, you show it *how* to do it with examples. This is especially useful when you want Claude to follow a specific style, format, or reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Few-shot Prompting Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few-shot prompt, you provide Claude with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Examples:**  One or more input-output pairs demonstrating the desired behavior.\n",
    "2.  **Query:** Your actual input for which you want Claude to generate an output, following the pattern shown in the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude learns from the examples and applies the learned pattern to generate a response to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want Claude to act as a \"rhyming poet\".  You can use few-shot prompting like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User:\n",
    "You are a rhyming poet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of your rhyming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The cat sat on the mat\n",
    "Rhyming Poem: There once was a cat, quite fat, Who loved to just sit on a mat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The dog chased the frog\n",
    "Rhyming Poem: A speedy young dog, in a jog, Once chased a green frog, in a bog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, write a rhyming poem for the following input:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The bird flew in the sky\n",
    "Rhyming Poem:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prompt, we provide two examples of \"Input\" and the corresponding \"Rhyming Poem\". Then, we give a new \"Input\" and ask Claude to complete the \"Rhyming Poem\". Claude will understand the pattern from the examples and generate a rhyming poem for the new input."
