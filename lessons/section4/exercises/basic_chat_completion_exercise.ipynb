    "# Basic Chat Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat completion is a fundamental task in interacting with large language models (LLMs). It involves sending a series of messages to the model and receiving a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory and Explanations**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Messages**: The input to the chat completion endpoint is a list of messages. Each message has a `role` (either `system`, `user`, or `assistant`) and `content` (the actual text of the message).\n",
    "*   **System Message**: The system message sets the behavior of the assistant. It can be used to provide instructions, context, or personality to the model.\n",
    "*   **User Message**: The user message represents the query or request from the user.\n",
    "*   **Assistant Message**: The assistant message represents a previous response from the assistant. This is useful for maintaining context in a conversation.\n",
    "*   **Model**: The `model` parameter specifies which LLM to use for the chat completion task.\n",
