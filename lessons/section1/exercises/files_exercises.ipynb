    "# File Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers basic file operations in Python, including reading from files, writing to files, and using `.env` files to store environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To read from a file, you can use the `open()` function with the `'r'` mode. The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file for reading\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, you can use the `open()` function with the `'w'` mode. The `write()` method writes the content to the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, its content will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file for writing\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('This is some text written to the file.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using .env Files\n",
    "\n",
    "`.env` files are used to store environment variables. You can use the `python-dotenv` library to load these variables into your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a `.env` file with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_KEY=your_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in your Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "\n",
    "api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')\n",
    "print(api_key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `my_file.txt` and write the following text to it: \"This is my first file operation exercise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the content of `my_file.txt` and print it to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.env` file with a variable named `MY_NAME` and set it to your name. Then, read the variable from the `.env` file and print it to the console."
