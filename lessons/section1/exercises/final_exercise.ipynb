    "\n",
    "Shalom and welcome! Get ready to dive into the exciting world of Israeli football through the lens of Python programming. This exercise is designed for complete beginners, so no prior coding experience is needed. We'll break down the fundamentals of Python while exploring the teams, players, and passion that make Israeli football unique.\n",

    "**Why Israeli Football?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the code, this exercise offers a glimpse into the cultural phenomenon that is Israeli football. From the heated rivalries to the unforgettable moments, football in Israel is more than just a game; it's a way of life. So, let's lace up our coding boots and get started!\n",

    "**Task Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to know who you cheer for! Use the `input()` function to ask the user for their favorite Israeli football team.\n",
    "2. Store their passionate response in a variable named `favorite_team`.\n",
    "3. Let's show some love! Print a message:  \n",
    "   `\"Great choice! [team] rocks the pitch!\"`  \n",

    "2. Let's give them the spotlight! Use a `for` loop to iterate over the dictionary and print a statement in the format:  \n",
    "   `\"Team: [team] | Star Player: [player]\"`\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
