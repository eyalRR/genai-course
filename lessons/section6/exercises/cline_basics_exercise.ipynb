    "Cline is an autonomous coding agent integrated into your IDE. It can create/edit files, run commands, use the browser, and more, with your permission every step of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: Use Cline to create a new file\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use Cline to create a new Python file named `my_script.py` with a simple function that prints \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Ask Cline to create a new file named `my_script.py`.\n",
    "2.  Ask Cline to add a function named `hello_world` to the file that prints \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "3.  Ask Cline to run the file and display the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: Use Cline to modify an existing file\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use Cline to modify the `my_script.py` file you created in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Ask Cline to add a new function named `add_numbers` to the file that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n",
    "2.  Ask Cline to call the `add_numbers` function with the arguments 5 and 10 and print the result.\n",
    "3.  Ask Cline to run the file and display the output."
